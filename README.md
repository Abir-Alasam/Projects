  ## The Wrangler - Design II is an autonomous robot built to compete in a ball-shooting challenge. It features a custom gravity-fed launching mechanism powered by geared DC motors and rubber wheels for optimal projectile grip and distance.
  
  The robot is controlled by an Arduino microcontroller, which processes data from an ultrasonic sensor to make strategic decisions on when to move forward, reverse, and fire its three balls. Its two-tiered base provides a stable and organized       platform for the electronics, while its versatile holonomic drive allows for omnidirectional movement.
  
  Key Features:
  
  Autonomous Targeting: Uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect opponents and adjust strategy.
  
  Adjustable Launcher: An angled, torque-based mechanism allows for precise range calibration.
  
  Omnidirectional Drive: Four-wheel holonomic drive provides full movement flexibility.
  
  Arduino Control: Custom algorithm dictates movement and firing sequences based on sensor input.
## Buoyancy Operated Aquatic Transport (B.O.A.T.) is a 3D-printed, motorized catamaran designed for a collegiate engineering design challenge. The goal was to create a sub-8-inch vessel capable of carrying a 50g payload and traversing a water channel within 30 seconds.

This project involved the full design cycle: conceptualizing three distinct hull designs, evaluating them based on propulsion, stability, and manufacturability, and selecting a dual-hull (catamaran) concept for its superior performance. The final design was modeled in SolidWorks, with buoyancy calculations confirming it would support its own weight and payload. Key features include a custom propeller, a lightweight platform connecting the two hulls, and an integrated motor assembly.

The physical prototype successfully met all competition requirements, demonstrating effective buoyancy, stability, and speed.
