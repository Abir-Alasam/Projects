  The Wrangler - Design II is an autonomous robot built to compete in a ball-shooting challenge. It features a custom gravity-fed launching mechanism powered by geared DC motors and rubber wheels for optimal projectile grip and distance.
  
  The robot is controlled by an Arduino microcontroller, which processes data from an ultrasonic sensor to make strategic decisions on when to move forward, reverse, and fire its three balls. Its two-tiered base provides a stable and organized       platform for the electronics, while its versatile holonomic drive allows for omnidirectional movement.
  
  Key Features:
  
  Autonomous Targeting: Uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect opponents and adjust strategy.
  
  Adjustable Launcher: An angled, torque-based mechanism allows for precise range calibration.
  
  Omnidirectional Drive: Four-wheel holonomic drive provides full movement flexibility.
  
  Arduino Control: Custom algorithm dictates movement and firing sequences based on sensor input.
